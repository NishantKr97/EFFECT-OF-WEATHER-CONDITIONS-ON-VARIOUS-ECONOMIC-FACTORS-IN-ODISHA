# EFFECT-OF-WEATHER-CONDITIONS-ON-VARIOUS-ECONOMIC-FACTORS-IN-ODISHA
This repository consists of the work done on the topic "EFFECT-OF-WEATHER-CONDITIONS-ON-VARIOUS-ECONOMIC-FACTORS-IN-ODISHA". The state of Odisha has 30 districts. Weather and Net District Domestic Product(NDDP) Data of each district is collected through various resources available online(mentioned in the References Section in the Main Project Report). The data collected is from 2002 - 2017. Then graphs are plotted corresponding to their Districts. Here the data of 2 districts are combined and shown in a single graph.
## Conclusion
The estimated regression coefficients of rainfall of January, April and july have positively
influenced the net revenue. It is also found from the study that the coefficients of the January temperature
and April temperature are negative whereas July temperature and October temperature share positive
relation with net revenue. The relation between the estimated 15 years trend of the seasonal climate
variables and the coefficients of regression analysis reveals that the negative trend of January rainfall for
the region might adversely affect farm level net revenue, which calls for a greater investment in irrigation
in this period. July rainfall is beneficial to farming activity in Odisha. On the other-hand, the increasing
trends of temperature for all the seasons might have adverse impact on the health of agriculture sector of
coastal Odisha .
